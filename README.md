# flutter_assignment_1

A new Flutter project.

## Background

This app was created for the first assignment under the Flutter & Dart Udemy course by "Maximilian".

The original instructions were as follows: 

```dart
// 1) Create a new Flutter App (in this project) and output an AppBar and some text
// below it
// 2) Add a button which changes the text (to any other text of your choice)
// 3) Split the app into three widgets: App, TextControl & Text
```

Some stretches were made to make the app more interesting. Rather than having just a button that will update the text, I've added a TextField that accepts input text which is used to update the text displayed. The TextField then clears itself.

Some concepts I've practiced/learned include:

- Passing down props through Stateful widgets (which I nixed)
- Adding padding / margin in different ways with Containers or Padding widgets
- How to use a `TextField`
- How to use a `TextEditingController`
- using methods like `onChange` in a `TextField` (nixed for controller)
